LTO-Overlay now has a patch for portage to automatically rebuild the index of
all static libraries built in LTO configurations using ranlib.  This is the
recommended way of fixing up stripped libraries according to the upstream
developers of sys-devel/binutils.  The patch is three lines and should apply
cleanly to both stable and unstable portage installations.  
With this change, STRIP_MASK is no longer necessary and LTO can be used safely
with EAPI version 7 packages.

To start using the patch, update `sys-config/ltoize` to the latest version,
remove STRIP_MASK from your `make.conf`, and re-emerge `sys-apps/portage`.
You will see a new message show up during emerges when static libraries are
built:

~~~
${RANLIB}: rebuilding index for ${STATIC_ARCHIVE}
~~~

This means that the patch is working as expected.
Users of LTO-Overlay are strongly encouraged to comment on issue #49 on GitHub (URL:
