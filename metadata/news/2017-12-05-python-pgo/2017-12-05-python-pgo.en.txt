LTO-Overlay now features PGO-enabled ebuilds of Python for versions 2.7,
3.4.6, 3.5, and 3.6.  The training set is similar to that of used on Debian,
Arch Linux, etc.  To use this, add "pgo" to your dev-lang/python's USE flags.
PGO is off by default, such that users who do not wish to use it are
unaffected.

Expect the build time of Python to increase dramatically with PGO on (as
expected).  However, once built, it runs much faster.

If you run into problems, please file an issue on the LTO-Overlay project's
GitHub
