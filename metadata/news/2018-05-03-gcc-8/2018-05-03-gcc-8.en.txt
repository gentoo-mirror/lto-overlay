The recommended compiler for use with lto-overlay has been changed to GCC 8.1.0 due to its enhanced LTO capabilities.
All workarounds will be reviewed as a result. This means users with older compilers with previously working configurations
could expect breakage if they do not upgrade. The first known breakage will be ffmpeg, which can now be built with Graphite.
No workarounds will be added for older compilers.

Remember after you upgrade your GCC to emerge -e @world to ensure
that no linking problems will occur with LTO libraries built using older GCCs. If you're having trouble,
create an issue in the project tracker on GitHub.
