sys-config/ltoize:ltopluginsymlink - Install a symlink to the currently active GCC's liblto_plugin.so into your binutils bfd_plugins directory. This is not recommended since the plugin symlink will not be automatically updated when the active GCC version changes. Also, it should not be necessary if packages respect AR, NM, and RANLIB properly.
